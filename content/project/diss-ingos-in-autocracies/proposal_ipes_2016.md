# Title

The Effect of Target-Country Restrictions and Authoritarian Politics on International NGO Programming

# Proposal

INGOs have emerged as a cornerstone of global governance and have become increasingly active in authoritarian regimes. Autocrats, in turn, work to regulate and restrict the activities and programming of international and foreign-funded NGOs working their countries, and often force INGOs to make difficult organizational decisions. What determines when INGOs adhere to authoritarian legal restrictions, resist government intrusions into organizational practices, or pull out of the country entirely? More generally, how do INGOs adapt to their institutional context and what tactics do they use to stay in engaged in the countries they target?

I present an original theoretical model to explain how international NGOs respond to authoritarian regulations and restrictions, showing how INGOs are strategic actors that are susceptible to the institutional environments of their target countries. I argue that an INGO's response to authoritarian restrictions comprises three components: (1) the organization's normative principles and ideals, (2) the organization's instrumental flexibility in actually implementing those principles, and (3) the alignment of an INGO's programming with regime preferences.

I examine this theory using survey data from a pool of 40,000 INGOs. With these results, I test each of the theory's mechanisms and determine how, why, and when INGOs shift their core values, become more flexible and instrumental, or attempt to induce the government to change its preferences. The results of this study contribute to academic debates on INGO behavior and provide practical guidance on how to mitigate institutional challenges to INGO programming.
