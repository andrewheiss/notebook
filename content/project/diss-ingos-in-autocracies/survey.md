# Consent

You have been invited to participate in a research survey about the relationship between international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and the governments of their host countries. This survey is part of a study by Andrew Heiss from Duke University in the United States, with oversight by his adviser, Dr. Judith Kelley.

Your participation is entirely voluntary and you are free to skip any question or withdraw from the survey at any time. The survey should take about 10 minutes to complete. *Please answer in whatever language you feel most comfortable using*.

Results from the survey will be used in aggregate so that it will not be possible to identify any individual organization. You can also explicitly choose to remain anonymous. Your responses will be securely transmitted to Qualtrics.com and stored in a password protected electronic format. The information you provide will be analyzed with statistical software and used in academic research.

You will receive no direct benefits from participating in this research study, but your responses may reveal important and useful insights in how INGOs relate to their host governments, which can benefit other similar organizations.

If you have any questions at any time about the study or the procedures, you can contact Andrew Heiss at andrew.heiss@duke.edu or +1 801-734-9327. You can also contact Dr. Judith Kelley at judith.kelley@duke.edu or +1 919-613-7343.

I have read the above information, and I consent to take part in the study.
