Slug: diss-ingos-in-autocracies

In the second half of my dissertation, I study how international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) are affected by the institutions and regulations of the countries they target. This half is closely linked to the [first half](/project/diss-autocracies-and-ingos/), which looks at how and why autocratic regimes establish and implement INGO regulations. The whole dissertation is [structured around this theory](https://ingorestrictions.org/theory/).

In the first chapter, I use the results of a [large survey](https://ingodata.org/survey/) to see if and how INGOs change their behavior in response to host-country regulations.

In the second chapter, I use detailed case studies of education and freedom of expression INGOs that work in Egypt and/or China to test how an INGO's deeply held values, instrumental concerns, and relationship with its host government affect its behavior.
