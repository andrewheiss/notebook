Slug: diss-autocracies-and-ingos

In the first half of my dissertation, I study how autocratic regimes regulate international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs). This half is closely linked to the [second half](/project/diss-ingos-in-autocracies/), which looks at how INGOs change their behavior when working in autocracies. The whole dissertation is [structured around this theory](https://ingorestrictions.org/theory/).

In the first chapter, I use large-N statistical analysis to determine when autocracies will limit and constrict the formal regulatory environment for INGOs.

In the second chapter, I use detailed case studies of Egypt and China to determine when autocracies will implement the de jure regulations and crack down on INGOs.
