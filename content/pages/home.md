I'm [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com), a PhD candidate at the [Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University](https://sanford.duke.edu/people/student/heiss-andrew). This is my open research notebookâ€”a centralized, public hub of notes and resources for all my ongoing (and past) research projects.

The best places to start in this notebook are with the active project pages or with the most recently modified notes. You can also sort the list of notes by date, tag, or alphabetically with the links in the sidebar.

You can also see [my GitHub repositories](https://github.com/andrewheiss) for all my other academic and programming work.
